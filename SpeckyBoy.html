            We’ve all made excuses for why we haven’t gotten started on something we
            really want to do. We’re too busy, or we haven’t prepared enough to get started.

            The truth is, there are a million excuses we all can use to avoid making the
            necessary choices and sacrifices we need to in order to truly succeed.
            However, sometimes those excuses are actually legitimate.

            Sometimes we really do need to figure things out first before we acquire our first clients.
            And, sometimes we really ought to quit working on an idea that’s clearly going to be a failure.

            The trouble is knowing whether our excuse is actually legitimate, or whether we’re just stalling.
            We’re going to explore some of the ways you can tell the difference, and start finishing everything you
            start.

        <h1>WordPress Plugin Acquisitions: What They Say About the Future</h1>
        <div class="image"><img class="img" src="wordpress.png" alt=WordPress></div>
        <p>
            The WordPress plugin marketplace is seeing quite a bit of consolidation lately. And, even if you aren’t a
            close
            follower of the business side of things, it’s likely some of these moves will impact you.

            For example, the recent sale of the wildly-popular Advanced Custom Fields plugin is a pretty big deal. The
            free
            version of the plugin is active on over a million websites. And that doesn’t even include those utilizing
            the
            commercial “PRO” version. It spent 10 years as a project of solo developer Elliot Condon. Now, it’s in the
            hands
            of the team at Delicious Brains.

            Other plugins changing hands include GiveWP, Kadence Blocks and Kanban for WordPress. Then there was the
            controversial move in which WP User Avatar was purchased and rebranded into a completely different plugin.
            We
            could go on, but you get the idea – there has been a lot of movement.

            What does this flurry of activity say about the state of WordPress and its future? The following are a few
            thoughts on what it all means. At least, according to this user’s perspective.
        </p>
        <h1>Should Web Designers Worry About Competition?</h1>
        <div class="image"><img class="img" src="spy.png" alt=Spy></div>
        <p>
            Virtually every business out there has competition – and it can get heated. For example, consider automobile
            manufacturers. Think about all the money they spend trying to one-up each other in both product features and
            marketing. Must be quite a stack of cash, huh?

            Web design, at least at the freelance and small agency level, doesn’t give off that same vibe. There may be
            dozens of design firms in a given geographic area. Yet, they’re more likely to take part in a collective
            meetup
            rather than attempt to publicly call each other out.

            Why is that? For one, the web design industry is based in part on sharing. It’s a community of people who
            freely
            share code, resources and advice. The widespread use of open-source software only encourages this behavior.

            That’s not to say that web designers aren’t driven to succeed. It’s just that they don’t mind seeing others
            do
            the same – even in a highly competitive field.

            Still, it brings up several questions. Do web designers need to spend time researching their competition?
            Should
            they worry about what other firms are doing? And, is there even any valuable information available?

                <p>
                    Flexbox is a popular CSS layout module that helps you position HTML
                    elements on the screen. There are multiple use cases when it can be
                    a godsend; horizontal and vertical centering is one of them.
                    Flexbox centering solves common alignment problems you might encounter
                    when working with the traditional CSS box model. It allows you to center
                    items within their container both horizontally and vertically with just
                    a few lines of CSS code.
